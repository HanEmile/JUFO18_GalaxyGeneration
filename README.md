# JUFO18_GalaxyGeneration
__Generating Galaxies and Visualizing them using Blender.__

The Project began during my Intership at the
[ZAH](https://zah.uni-heidelberg.de/welcome/)
(Zentrum FÃ¼r Astronomie der Uni Heidelberg) thank's to
[@tugi](https://github.com/tugi).

The Repo we created during that time can be found
[here](https://github.com/HanEmile/Heidelberg)

The Code is split up into two parts (03.12.17): The first part creates the
data using [Python](https://python.org) so the second part can visualize it in
[Blender](https://blender.org).
